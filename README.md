## Motivation

Suppose you aim at creating quickly an adventure game (let say for a birthday gift, or whatever). Instead of learning how to program, learning a new framework, learning how to use a map editor... you just use your already installed spreadsheet software (such as Libre Office Calc, Microsoft Excel, etc.). Also, easy and funny to invite many friends to collaborate for the level design.


## How to use the engine

- Assets are in the corresponding folder
- the map is described in map.csv. Each cell is a tile.
- Use upper case for obstacles.
- Lower case for regular decor.
- Greek letters for passages.
- objXXXX for objects to collect.
- and if needed write some scripts in script.js

## Roadmap

Coming soon:
- title screen
- ennemies
